     - TypeScript uses a concept called type inference. The moment we assign a value to a variable, TypeScript tries to infer the type from the assignment

     - TYPE: A type is a classification of data that defines the operations that can be done on that data,
       the meaning of the data, and the set of allowed values. Typing is checked by the compiler and/or run time to ensure the integrity of the data, enforce access restrictions, and interpret the data as meant by the developer.

  - For type declaration create "_.d.ts" and for ambient declaration create "_.ambient.ts"

  - Ambient declaration - To make globals known and defined, we can use ambient type declarations. These types are encompassing, existing and present on all sides.

    - If your TypeScript code needs to use a library that was written with plain JavaScript, you can always write Ambient Declaration that describes the types that would have been there, had it been written in TypeScript. For example, if you had to use a npm package firetruck that looked like this
      `async function extinguish(theta, phi, pressure) { await aimHose(theta, phi); await sprayWater(pressure); }`
      `export default extinguish;`

    You can create a Type Def. file
    // firetruck.d.ts
    `declare function extinguish(theta: number,phi: number, pressure: number): Promise<void>;`
    `export default extinguish;`

    While writing Custom Types, please keep in mind that - Inappropriately strict types are more annoying (and more destructive to the code of your users) than inappropriately loose types.

  - Tooling
    - Install typescript globally - `npm install -g typescript`
    - Create a Folder called `@types` into project's root folder, and move type definitions and `ambient` declarations into it.
    - Initi TypeScript configuration file (`tsconfig.json`) - `tsc --init`
    - Add your type declarations in `typeRoots` section = {..., typeRoots: ["@types", "node_modules/@types"]}

- 2. Working with Types

  - Type Annotation
  - Type Inference
  - Primitive (number, boolean, string) and Complex Types (objects, arrays, functions)

  - TypeScript that generates JavaScript is called `emitting`.

  - Left-Hand Typing

    - The moment we annonate using the colon syntax, the name is of the type we annotate.
    - Called `left-hand-typing` as the typing happens before to the EQUAL Sign.
    - Also called as explicit typing.
    - Example - const total: number; const sum: number = 0;

  - Right-Hand Typing -

    - Leaving out the type and working first with the `type inference` is called `right-hand-typing`
    - Typing happens to the right of the equals sign, be it through a VALUE ASSIGNMENT and INFERENCE, or via the type of a function's return value.
    - Example - const table = "TEST" // Type inference - string type

  - `any` is a WILDCARD!

- 3. Functions

  - Function Signatures
  - Function Heads
  - Function Bodies
  - Structural Typing for Functions

- 4. Union and Intersection Types

  - Define concrete types for values
  - Perform Algebraic operations on the Types
  - Widening and Narrowing Types
  - Top and Bottom Types

- 5. Generics

  - A way to prepare for the unknown
  - Where we know a certain behaviour of a type but cannot exactly model this behaviour
  - Generic Constraints, Binding Generics, Mapped Types, Type Modifiers

- 6. Conditional Types

- 7. Thinking in Types

  - Real world and Complex Use Cases

- Enable TS in JS file
  - to define a type - /\*_ @type ShipStorage _/
  - enable ts check on the file - // @ts-check
  - Add `@typedef` in JSDoc - /** @typedef { import('./types.d').ShipStorage } ShipStorage **/

KEYWORDS

- TypeScript uses a concept called type inference.
- A Type ensure the integrity of the data and enforce access restrictions
- Javascript is Weakly Typed
- Typescript is Strongly Typed
- Type safety is a way to be very intentional about what types to expect. Makiny Typescript Aware of our Semantics of our program
- Use Ambient Declaration for global flags / thrid party library
- Inappropriately strict types are more annoying (and more destructive to the code of your users) than inappropriately loose types.
- TypeScript Control Flow Analysis (CFA)
  - Type Guard (if else type assignment or checking)
  - Type Guard (`null` Guard, `typeof` Guard, `instanceof` Guard, `in` Guard)
- TypeScript uses a concept called `type inference` to automatically detect types of constants, functions, and variables.
- TypeScript is a `structural type system`, which means that TypeScript cares a lot about the shape or structure of objects and functions.
- Ambient type declarations allowed us to set type information for globals like jQuery or custom environment flags.
- TypeScript that generates JavaScript is called `emitting`.
- `any` is a WILDCARD!
