     - TypeScript uses a concept called type inference. The moment we assign a value to a variable, TypeScript tries to infer the type from the assignment

     - TYPE: A type is a classification of data that defines the operations that can be done on that data,
       the meaning of the data, and the set of allowed values. Typing is checked by the compiler and/or run time to ensure the integrity of the data, enforce access restrictions, and interpret the data as meant by the developer.

  - For type declaration create "_.d.ts" and for ambient declaration create "_.ambient.ts"

  - Ambient declaration

    - If your TypeScript code needs to use a library that was written with plain JavaScript, you can always write Ambient Declaration that describes the types that would have been there, had it been written in TypeScript. For example, if you had to use a npm package firetruck that looked like this
      `async function extinguish(theta, phi, pressure) { await aimHose(theta, phi); await sprayWater(pressure); }`
      `export default extinguish;`

    You can create a Type Def. file
    // firetruck.d.ts
    declare function extinguish(theta: number,phi: number, pressure: number): Promise<void>;
    export default extinguish;

    While writing Custom Types, please keep in mind that - Inappropriately strict types are more annoying (and more destructive to the code of your users) than inappropriately loose types.

- 2. Working with Types

  - Type Annotation
  - Type Inference
  - Primitive (number, boolean, string) and Complex Types (objects, arrays, functions)

- 3. Functions

  - Function Signatures
  - Function Heads
  - Function Bodies
  - Structural Typing for Functions

- 4. Union and Intersection Types

  - Define concrete types for values
  - Perform Algebraic operations on the Types
  - Widening and Narrowing Types
  - Top and Bottom Types

- 5. Generics

  - A way to prepare for the unknown
  - Where we know a certain behaviour of a type but cannot exactly model this behaviour
  - Generic Constraints, Binding Generics, Mapped Types, Type Modifiers

- 6. Conditional Types

- 7. Thinking in Types

  - Real world and Complex Use Cases

- Enable TS in JS file
  - to define a type - /\*_ @type ShipStorage _/
  - enable ts check on the file - // @ts-check
  - Add `@typedef` in JSDoc - /** @typedef { import('./types.d').ShipStorage } ShipStorage **/

KEYWORDS

- TypeScript uses a concept called type inference.
- A Type ensure the integrity of the data and enforce access restrictions
- Javascript is Weakly Typed
- Typescript is Strongly Typed
- Type safety is a way to be very intentional about what types to expect. Makiny Typescript Aware of our Semantics of our program
- Use Ambient Declaration for global flags / thrid party library
- Inappropriately strict types are more annoying (and more destructive to the code of your users) than inappropriately loose types.
